    "## Problem Framing\n",

    "Machine learning is not a solution looking for a problem, but is instead one of a variety of solutions that might work for an existing problem. Given this, we should begin our journey by understanding the problem we are trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular case, we would like to be able to **predict the price of a house in California**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions we should ask ourselves might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Predict the price when? Now? In the past? In the future? For what range?\n",
    "*  What is our tolerance for being wrong?\n",
    "*  Are we okay with a few huge outliers if the overall model is better?\n",
    "*  What metrics are we using to define success and what are the acceptable values?\n",
    "*  Is there an non-ML way to solve this problem?\n",
    "*  What data is available to solve the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of questions is boundless. Eventually you'll need to move on, but understanding the problem and the solution space is vital.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "For this problem we'll further define the problem by saying:\n",
    "\n",
    ">  We want to create a system that predicts the prices of houses in California in 1990. We have census data from 1990 available to build and test the system. We will accept a system with a root mean squared error of 200,000 or better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a contrived example we'll short-cut and say that our analysis has led us to believe that we want to use a linear regression model to serve as our prediction system."
